The  management in small gyms occurs in manual way. This requires a reasonable consumption of physical resources and time. Therefore the project proposes to integrate an emerging area in which the use of ICT resources is still wasted for a better knowledge of the business of the company, reducing the problem of allocation of physical space, since with the same it is possible to preserve digital copies by building a data base, and with this becomes practical, because through the division between modules, allows the insertion of data by the employee in the web system, one can have control over the registered employees, maintenance of registered customers, available equipment, assessments and gymcard. Through the registers, the professional ensures greater control of student flow, frequency control and goals, and have a quick access to the monitoring of the deadlines for the next assessments, being divided into: close, up-to-date and late assessments. From the Android system, the customer can check their ratings, goals, gymcards and personal data.
